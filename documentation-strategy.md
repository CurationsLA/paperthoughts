# Why This Works for CURATIONS:

## Markdown Files (.md)
- GitHub renders them beautifully
- Easy to edit without code knowledge
- Evelyn can update content directly
- Version control tracks changes

## Heavy Comments
```javascript
// This isn't over-commenting
// It's building a knowledge base
// Each comment = avoided future question
```

## File Headers
```typescript name=filename.ts
// Immediately know what file does
// No confusion about purpose
// GitHub shows these in searches
```
