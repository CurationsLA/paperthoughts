# WHAT I'LL DO WITH YOUR 4 THEMES:

## 1. IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS
```javascript
// I'll examine each file for:
- What the theme ACTUALLY shows (not sports!)
- Duplicate elements from previous LLM
- Salvageable components
- Unique features worth keeping
```

## 2. CREATE CLEAN VERSIONS
```html
<!-- basketball-raw.html â†’ theme-1-clean.html -->
<!-- Remove duplicates, preserve intent -->
<!-- Document what each theme represents -->
```

## 3. INTEGRATION STRATEGY
```
OPTION A: Combine best elements into main site
OPTION B: Keep as 4 separate inspiration paths
OPTION C: Extract components for modular use
```
