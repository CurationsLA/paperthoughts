# WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE:

4 inspirational themes with RANDOM sports names to prevent:
- Firebase deployment conflicts
- Duplicate component errors  
- Name collision issues

The themes themselves have NOTHING to do with sports!
They're likely variations of:
- Brutalist designs
- AI+Human interfaces
- Creative campaign layouts
- CURATIONS brand concepts

# TO PREVIEW CORRECTLY:

I'll help preview WITHOUT assuming sports content
