# CLEARING UP THE CONFUSION:
# ❌ WRONG: "Basketball" = motion-focused theme
# ✅ RIGHT: "Basketball" = random name for Theme #1 (could be anything!)

# The sports names were anti-collision slugs, like:
basketball-v2.html  → Actually might be brutalist design
tennis-v3.css       → Could be gradient purple theme
golf-main.js        → Might be AI discovery section
soccer-hero.png     → Could be youth curator interface
