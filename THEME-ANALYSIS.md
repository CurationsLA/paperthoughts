# CURATIONS Theme Analysis (Initial Raw Capture)

Status: INITIAL (raw placeholders exist; awaiting real content)

| File (Flat) | File (Nested) | Detected Title | Notable Duplications | Inline Styles? | External Assets | Next Action |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| previews/basketball.html | inspiration/theme-previews/basketball-raw.html | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | Replace raw, parse |
| previews/tennis.html     | inspiration/theme-previews/tennis-raw.html     | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | Replace raw, parse |
| previews/golf.html       | inspiration/theme-previews/golf-raw.html       | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | Replace raw, parse |
| previews/soccer.html     | inspiration/theme-previews/soccer-raw.html     | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | (pending) | Replace raw, parse |

## Deduplication Plan
1. Insert real markup for each raw theme.
2. Script or manual scan:
   - Identify repeating sections (hero, nav, footers, repeated feature blocks).
   - Normalize whitespace & remove inline style duplicates.
3. Produce `*-clean.html` versions in both structures (or decide to keep only flat).
4. Update comparison pages to toggle `raw` vs `clean`.

## Clean Variant Naming (Proposed)
- basketball-clean.html
- tennis-clean.html
- golf-clean.html
- soccer-clean.html

Nested:
- basketball-clean.html inside `inspiration/theme-previews/` (mirroring pattern).
