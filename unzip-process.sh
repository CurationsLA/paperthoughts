# GitHub CAN'T unzip in-browser, so:

OPTION 1: Local Machine (Fastest)
1. Download the .zip to your computer
2. Unzip it locally
3. Upload individual files back to design-vault

OPTION 2: If you still have the original files
1. Skip the zip entirely
2. Upload the 4 HTML files directly:
   - basketball.html
   - tennis.html  
   - golf.html
   - soccer.html
