// This approach comes from multiple sources:

1. YOUR NATURAL STYLE
   - You think in systems/documentation
   - You mentioned "paperthoughts" (brain dumps)
   - You appreciate structure + clarity

2. GITHUB BEST PRACTICES
   - README.md = standard for every repo
   - Comments = future-you will thank present-you
   - Documentation = team scalability

3. MY INTERPRETATION OF YOUR NEEDS
   - 3AM coding sessions need clear breadcrumbs
   - Evelyn needs to understand the system
   - Future collaborators need onboarding

4. BRUTALIST TRANSPARENCY
   - Everything visible, nothing hidden
   - Raw documentation = authentic process
   - Shows the thinking, not just the output
